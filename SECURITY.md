# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Smart Archival Information Security System implements multiple layers of security to protect your documents and data. This document outlines the security features, best practices, and considerations for administrators and users.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

#### Password Security
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash` function with PBKDF2
- **Salted Hashes**: Each password has a unique salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text

#### Session Management
- **Flask-Login**: Secure session handling with server-side storage
- **Session Cookies**: HTTPOnly cookies prevent JavaScript access
- **Session Timeouts**: Configurable session expiration
- **Remember Me**: Optional persistent login with secure tokens

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Three User Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Full system access, user management, audit logs
  - **User**: Document management, upload, search
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to shared/public documents

- **Access Control Decorators**:
  - `@login_required`: Ensures user is authenticated
  - `@admin_required`: Restricts access to administrators
  - `@viewer_or_above`: Allows authenticated users

### 2. Document Security

#### File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 16MB per file (configurable)
- **Filename Sanitization**: Uses `secure_filename()` to prevent path traversal
- **Unique Filenames**: Generates unique names to prevent overwrites

#### Access Control
- **Private Documents**: Only the owner can access
- **Shared Documents**: Visible to all authenticated users
- **Public Documents**: Visible to everyone (if public access is enabled)
- **Ownership Verification**: Users can only edit/delete their own documents

#### Secure Storage
- **Filesystem Storage**: Files stored outside web root
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Permission Checks**: Verified on every access attempt

### 3. Audit Logging

#### Comprehensive Tracking
The system logs all significant activities:
- User registration and login/logout
- Document uploads, views, downloads, edits, deletions
- Administrative actions (user activation/deactivation)
- Search queries
- Failed authentication attempts

#### Audit Log Information
Each log entry includes:
- User ID and username
- Action performed
- Resource type and ID
- Detailed description
- IP address
- Timestamp

#### Log Security
- **Immutable Logs**: Logs cannot be edited by regular users
- **Admin-Only Access**: Only administrators can view full logs
- **Retention**: Logs are stored indefinitely by default

### 4. Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **In Transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS in production (configured separately)
- **At Rest**: Database stored on filesystem (consider full-disk encryption)
- **Password Hashing**: Industry-standard PBKDF2 algorithm

#### Input Validation
- **Form Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection
- **XSS Prevention**: Template auto-escaping prevents cross-site scripting

### 5. Application Security

#### Flask Security Features
- **Secret Key**: Strong, random secret key for session signing
- **CSRF Protection**: Can be enabled with Flask-WTF (recommended for production)
- **Secure Headers**: Can be configured with Flask-Talisman

#### File Security
- **Extension Whitelist**: Only approved file types allowed
- **MIME Type Verification**: Can be enhanced with python-magic
- **Upload Directory Isolation**: Separate from application code

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

#### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Generate a strong secret key
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Set restrictive file permissions
chmod 600 .env
chmod 755 uploads logs
```

#### 2. Production Configuration
```python
# config.py
class ProductionConfig(Config):
    DEBUG = False
    TESTING = False
    # Use environment variables
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
    # Use PostgreSQL or MySQL
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URI')
    # Enable HTTPS
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'
```

#### 3. Web Server Configuration
Use a reverse proxy (Nginx) with SSL/TLS:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### 4. Database Security
- **Regular Backups**: Automated daily backups
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypt backup files
- **Access Control**: Restrict database file permissions
- **Separate Server**: Use dedicated database server in production

#### 5. File Storage Security
- **Separate Partition**: Store uploads on separate partition
- **Disk Encryption**: Enable full-disk encryption
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of upload directory
- **Antivirus Scanning**: Scan uploaded files (optional)

#### 6. User Management
- **Strong Password Policy**: Enforce minimum length and complexity
- **Account Lockout**: Implement after failed login attempts (future enhancement)
- **Regular Audits**: Review user accounts periodically
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign minimum necessary permissions

#### 7. Monitoring
- **Review Audit Logs**: Check for suspicious activities regularly
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Monitor for brute force attacks
- **Unusual File Activity**: Watch for mass downloads or deletions
- **System Resources**: Monitor disk space and performance

#### 8. Updates and Maintenance
```bash
# Keep dependencies updated
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Check for security advisories
pip-audit  # Install: pip install pip-audit

# Review changelogs for security fixes
```

### For Users

#### 1. Password Security
- **Strong Passwords**: Use at least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
- **Unique Passwords**: Don't reuse passwords from other sites
- **Password Managers**: Consider using a password manager
- **Regular Changes**: Change passwords periodically

#### 2. Account Security
- **Log Out**: Always log out on shared computers
- **Remember Me**: Only use on personal devices
- **Suspicious Activity**: Report unusual activity to administrators
- **Email Security**: Protect your registered email account

#### 3. Document Handling
- **Sensitive Data**: Don't upload highly sensitive documents without additional encryption
- **Access Levels**: Choose appropriate visibility settings
- **Regular Review**: Audit your documents and access levels
- **Deletion**: Permanently delete when no longer needed

#### 4. Safe Practices
- **Verify URLs**: Ensure you're on the correct website
- **Avoid Phishing**: Don't click suspicious links
- **Public Networks**: Avoid accessing sensitive documents on public Wi-Fi
- **Screen Privacy**: Be aware of shoulder surfing

## Compliance Considerations

Depending on your use case, consider compliance with:
- **GDPR**: For EU user data
- **HIPAA**: For healthcare information
- **SOC 2**: For service organizations
- **ISO 27001**: For information security management

This system provides a foundation, but additional controls may be needed for specific compliance requirements.
